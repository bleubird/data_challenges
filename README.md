Practice exploring and analyzing sample data sets

These IPython notebooks contain work exploring and analyzing sample data sets. Data challenge 1 task was to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), given a set of attributes about the cell. Data challenge 2 task was to find any actionable insights in aggregated data collected from five European shops.
