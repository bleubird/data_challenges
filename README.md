# Exploring and analyzing sample datasets

These IPython notebooks contain samples of my work exploring and analyzing two data sets. Data challenge 1 task was to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign or malignant, given a set of attributes about the cell. Data challenge 2 task was to find any actionable insights in aggregated data collected from five European shops.
